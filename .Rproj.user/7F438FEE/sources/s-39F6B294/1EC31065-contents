# shinyAppDemo

The shinyAppDemo package has been created to demonstrate one method of packaging a Shiny application.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("WilliamKopans/MatchPackageBETA")
```

...or...

``` r
source("https://install-github.me/WilliamKopans/MatchPackageBETA")
```

## Run the Shiny app

There's only one exported function in the package and it runs the Shiny app:

``` r
shinyAppDemo::launchApp()
Match::launchApp()
```
